# MyOS
A new OS paradigm for LINUX

**MyOS** is an experimental Linux desktop concept that puts the user and their projects at the center — not the underlying technology.  
The goal is an intuitive, context-sensitive environment where everything revolves around your current project and its structure.

## 🌱 Project Status

**Current Phase:** Concept development, prototyping, and community building.  
Not a complete operating system yet — early experiments with filesystem integrations, GUI concepts, and workflow tools.

## 🎯 What is MyOS?

- **Project-Based Desktop:** Instead of a classic multi-user setup → a multi-project environment for a single user.  
  Each project has its own desktop, launcher, wallpaper, and app configuration. Open windows stay tied to their respective projects.

- **Deep Obsidian Integration:** Obsidian becomes the default text and note editor — running in a clean, distraction-free "Zen mode".  
  Every project is automatically an Obsidian Vault.

- **Standardized Project Folder Structures:** Projects offer predefined but initially hidden folders (`finance`, `legal`, `docs`, etc.),  
  which only become visible when needed.

- **Permissions and Localization:** Folder names and access rights can be customized per project and language preference, without technical hurdles.

## 🚀 Vision

The tools for all this already exist — but they're overly complicated and fragmented.  
**MyOS** aims to unify these capabilities into one clean, intuitive environment with smart defaults and a gentle learning curve.
